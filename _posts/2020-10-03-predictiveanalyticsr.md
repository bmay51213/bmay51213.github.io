## Predictive Analytics: Final Project

# Background:

Fetal heart rate monitoring as an indicator of fetal well-being can be inaccurate as predictors of a poor neonatal outcome and come with significant healthcare and medicolegal costs.  It is the goal of this project to use a database of specific technical characteristics of fetal heart rate monitoring from the UCI machine learning database to develop a predictive model using an automated system to better identify worrisome decreases in fetal heart rate.

The data that I will primarily use is from the University of California â€“ Irvine Machine Learning Repository.  The dataset can be found at the following web address: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Cardiotocography.

According to the website, there were over 2000 fetal heart tracings (cardiotocograms) and interpreted by three expert obstetricians.  Many of the measurements include the technical measurements include heart rate accelerations, decelerations, max heart rate, minimum heart rates, heart rate baseline and finally the target variable is whether the tracing was normal, suspect, or pathologic.

```{r loading packages, echo = TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(readxl)
library(tidyverse)

toco <- read_excel("fetal monitoring.xls", sheet = 'Raw Data')
```

We will drop the identifier and date columns as they are not needed and will also remove the four rows with NA at the end of the spreadsheet.  These data are not labelled and appear to be possibly summary information that will be accounted for with the individual variables and will be excluded from the analysis.

```{r dropping identifiers, echo = TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

df <- toco %>% select(-FileName, -Date, -SegFile)
df <- na.omit(df)
summary(df)
```

```{r coding categoricals, echo = TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
cols = (c("Tendency", "A", "B", "C", "D", "AD", "DE", "LD", "FS", "SUSP", "CLASS", "NSP"))

df[cols] <- lapply(df[cols], factor)
df$E <- as.factor(df$E)
str(df)
```

Next, histograms and bar graphs were plotted to check the distributions of the variables.

```{r graphs, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

## Initial Analysis:

Both baseline FHR by both expert and computerized measurements appeared normally distributed with an approximately normal range of FHR 110 - 160.  This is the expected normal range of a fetal heart rate during labor and delivery.  Any heart rates outside these ranges is abnormal and requires investigation and/or intervention.  Several of the variables appeared positively skewed meaning that there were a larger number of values at the lower end of the x values.  These variables were: Accelerations, Fetal Movement, Mean Time With Abnormal Short-Term Variability, % of time with abnormal long-term variability, mean time with abnormal long-term variability, Light Decelerations, Severe Decelerations, Prolonged Decelerations, and Number of Histogram Peaks and Zeros.

One finding that I think bears mentioning is that the variable for repeated decelerations were all 0's meaning there were no cases with repetitive decelerations, which could be concerning.  Further, the distribution of the target variable is going to require some balancing or penalties in the final model.  The vast majority of the records were read as normal.  A smaller minority were rated as suspect and the smallest proportion was pathological.  For practitioners, this is a good thing because this means that less pathologic conditions were identified which is beneficial for an infant's health.  However, for prediction, the algorithm will have to be fine tuned to weight the target classes appropriately to not always assume a tracing was normal.

Next, we will plan on exploring some bivariate plots to analyze relationships.  One that I am most interested in is the relation between fetal heart rate and the target variable of normal, suspect, or pathologic.

On exploratory analysis of the input variables to the target variable of NSP, there were several trends that are consistent with known associations of pathologic categories.  There was higher variance of values in the histograms of the fetal heart rates in the pathologic category.  There also tended to be higher amounts of time with percentage of time spent with abnormal short and long-term variability.  The number of uterine contractions/second were lower in the pathologic category.  The number of decelerations were higher in the pathologic category and FHR tended to be lower in the pathologic categories as well.  This validates the common findings that more pathologic findings are noted in fetal heart rate tracings with less variability, lower fetal heart rates, and more decelerations.

The data was examined for high levels of correlation between the input variables to look for redundancy.  The categorical variables (almost all of which are the target variables) were excludede.

```{r correlation, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(corrplot)

nums <- df %>% select(-A, -B, -C, -D, -E, -AD, -DE, -LD, -FS, -SUSP, -CLASS, -NSP, -Tendency, -DR)
corr <- cor(nums)
corr
corrplot(corr, method="circle")
```

A correlation plot was created to look for high levels of correlation between the input variables and only the numerical variables were included.  There appeared to be high levels of correlation between the beginning and ending measurements variable in addition to high levels of correlation between expert and automated determination of fetal heart rate.  Finally, mode, mean, and median variables were all highly correlated with each other based on the histogram values.  These variables will need to be assessed using feature selection to see if simplification will increase predictive accuracy.
